# This script is for getting and building the 3rd party libraries that the MEGA SDK uses (some are optional, and some are only needed only by MEGA apps too)
# 
# Your 3rdParty library builds should be outside the SDK repo.  We are moving to use vcpkg to build most of them. You can start it like this:
#
# mkdir 3rdParty
# cd 3rdParty
# git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
# cd vcpkg
# .\bootstrap-vcpkg.sh -disableMetrics
#
# Comment out any libraries that you won't use.
# If using pdfium, follow the instructions below to get the source code
#
# On Mac, go to ports/libraw/CONTROL and comment out the freeglut dependency
# 
# From your 3rdParty/vcpkg folder, run this script (in its proper location) with the desired triplet as the parameter.  (usually x64-linux or x64-osx)
